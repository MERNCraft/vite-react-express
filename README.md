# How to Serve a React Frontend with Express #

[Full tutorial](https://merncraft.github.io/vite-react-express/)

When creating a web site using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS), you might use:

1. Vite to develop your frontend
2. Express to develop your backend
3. A hosting site such as Render.com to host your frontend and backend separately.

Having the frontend run from a different origin URL than the backend means that you will have to deal with CORS issues (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

This project shouws you how to build a workflow to use your Express backend to serve the files for your React frontend.
