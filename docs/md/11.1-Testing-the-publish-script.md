To check that `npm run publish` will perform both the `build` and the `publish` actions:

 1. With your Terminal window active in the parent folder, delete the entire contents of the `backend/public/` directory:
```bash-w
rm -r backend/public/*
```


The Terminal will ask you to type `y` (for "yes") to confirm that you really want to do this
```bash-w
$ rm -r backend/public/* 
sure you want to delete all 3 files in /path/to/backend/public [yn]? 
```


If you refresh the browser page that is connected to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), you should now see `Cannot GET /`, because there is nothing in the `backend/public/` directory.

1. Run a similar command to empty the `frontend/dist/` directory:

```bash-w
rm -r frontend/dist/*
```

2. Run `npm run publish`

The Terminal should show you lots of activity:
```bash-#
$ publish
> npm run build && ./publish.sh


> myproject@1.0.0 build
> npm --prefix ./frontend run build


> frontend@0.0.0 build
> vite build

3. Refresh the browser page that is connected to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You should now see the default Vite page again.

<summary>Are we done yet?</summary>
It looks like you could stop here. Now you can simply develop your frontend with Vite and React, and run `npm run publish` when you are getting ready to deploy. But this is only true if:

- Your frontend will not make any API requests to the backend (but why would you even _want_ to use a backend if you don't make any API requests to it?) 
- Your frontend will not use React-Router to navigate to pages which only the frontend knows about.

If _both_ of these statements are true then you can skip forward to the section [43. Deploying](#deploy-to-render-com).

If not... continue to the next section.
