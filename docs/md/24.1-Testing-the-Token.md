1. Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
2. Click on the `GET /ping` button.

Everything should work as before. You should see something like the following in the Terminal window where you ran `npm start`:
```bash-w
referer: http://localhost:3000/
payload: http://localhost:3000/
Connection from
referer http://localhost:3000/
origin  undefined
ip      ::ffff:127.0.0.1
for     http://localhost:3000/ping
at      Wed Nov 20 2024 09:40:47 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)
```
   
   
The `referer` and the `payload`. match.

3. Now type  [http://localhost:3000/ping](http://localhost:3000/ping) in the browser address bar.

Before you saw something like:

Now you get rejected. If you check in the Developer Tools, you'll see that the cookie has been set, and that it was sent to the server, and that the server has responded with a `401 status: Unauthorized.`

![Not Admitted](images/3000NotAdmitted.webp)

You can find the reason in the Terminal where your server is running:

```bash-#
referer: undefined , req.path: /ping
payload: http://localhost:3000/
```

The browser sent no `referer` header, because the request came from the browser's address bar and not from somewhere inside a loaded web page.

<summary>Coping with rejection</summary>
Granted, this technique prevents a visitor from connecting directly to you the API endpoints of your backend, but it's not very user-friendly.

There's a better solution than sending a `401: Unauthorized` message. Can you think of it?

Actually, you've already seen what the Vite development server does when you visit an unknown path. Remember how the frontend behaved when you originally made a request for [http://localhost:5173/ping](http://localhost:5173/ping) (which doesn't exist)?

Here's what I wrote back then:

> Whenever you make a request to the Vite development server, it will respond with the `index.html` page, regardless of the path that you use.

<summary>Time for Whack-a-mole</summary>
In a little while, I'll get you to explore how Router-React-DOM works when a Vite React frontend is hosted by Express. The solution to the issues that you'll encounter there is the same as the solution that you could use here to make direct API requests more user friendly.

For now, perhaps you'd just like to go outside and take a break and let your mind wander a bit, so that it can suggest the solution to you before I tell you.

But first, we've got that Whack-a-mole problem to deal with.
