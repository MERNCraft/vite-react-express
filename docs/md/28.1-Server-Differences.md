  <h2><a href="#server-differences">How Express is different from the Vite development server</a></h2>

As you may have noticed, the Vite development server always serves the `index.html` page, even when you define a custom path. If you are not using a client-side router like `react-router-dom`, the display in the browser will not change. When you add client-side routing with `react-router-dom`, it is the JavaScript in the browser that changes the display and the URL in the address bar.

Your Express router works differently.

* If there is a file that matches the request in the `public/` folder, it will serve that.
* If there is an API route that matches the `path` part of the requested URL, it will do what it can to respond to that.
* If there is no route matching the path, the `checkPass()` function in the `jwToken.js` script will send a 40X "invalid path" message, like the ones you have just seen.

## Making Express behave like the Vite development server

Instead of sending a 40X "invalid path" message, you can make your Express server return the `index.html` page, just like the Vite development server does, if the `payload` does not match the `referer`.

Edit the `backend/jwToken.js` script to:

1. Add two lines at the beginning to generate the absolute path to the file at `backend/public/index.html`
2. Change the  way the `treatPass()` function deals with errors or invalid API requests. Specifically: use `res.sendFile(index)` if the API request was invalid in any way, but allow it to proceed if no irregularity was found.

```js-
<i>/**
 * backend/jwToken.js
 */</i>

<b>const { join } = require('path')
const INDEX_HTML = join(process.cwd(), 'public/index.html')</b>

const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || "secret needed"
const is_dev = process.env.IS_DEV === "true"
```
```js-s
// Some lines skipped
```
```js-#59
<i>  function treatPass(error, payload) {
    console.log("payload:", payload)</i>

    <b>const sendHome = 
       error    // the JWT token was invalid
    || !referer // the request did not come from a page
    || referer && !referer.startsWith(payload) // invalid referer

    if (sendHome) {
      // Ignore API request: respond with index.html file 
      return res.sendFile(INDEX_HTML)
    }</b>

    <i>proceed() // with API request
  }</i>
```
```js-s
// all lines to the end skipped
```


The line `return res.sendFile(index)` instructs your server to treat all unknown requests as a request for the `/` site root, which delivers the `index.html` page. This means that the JavaScript in the frontend can deal with the display and the URL to show in the browser's address bar, just as it does with the Vite development server...

## The `referer` has changed

Did you notice this expression: `!referer.startsWith(payload)`? That's new. Before, you checked if `payload !== referer`. It might be good to take a close look at the value `referer` in the request for the `/ping` API route.

1. Click on the link for `Ping`
2. Click on the `GET /ping` button

![The referer now reflects the URL in the browser's address bar](images/referer.webp)

Do you see that? Earlier, when you weren't using `react-router-dom` to generate client-side routes, the `referer` was simply `http://localhost:3000`. Now it's `http://localhost:3000/ping`.

Here's what it looked like before:

![or "Figure 13 revisited"](images/localping.webp)

Now, if you look in the Terminal where `nodemon` is running your Express server, you will see that the `referer` contains the `/ping` path, because of the way `react-router-dom` updates URLs in the browser:
```bash-#
referer: http://localhost:3000/ping , req.path: /ping
payload: http://localhost:3000/
```


In other words, the `referer` string is longer than the expected value that is stored in `payload`. Instead of comparing the two values exactly, you can check if `referer.startsWith(payload)`. If it does, then the server can be sure that the request is legitimate.
