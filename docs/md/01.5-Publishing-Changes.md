Suppose you make a change to the frontend. 

![A change in the frontend is updated live by Vite's development server](images/editFrontend.webp)

However, the site served by the backend doesn't change. It takes only one command to fix this. 

1. Open a new Terminal in the Project directory
2. Run the following command

```bash-w
npm run publish
```

You should see that this command tells Vite to `build` a `dist` directory containing all the files needed to deploy the React site. Then it copies the contents of the `dist` directory to the `backend/public` folder.

```bash-w
james@M1 Project % <b>npm run publish</b>

> vite-react-express@1.0.0 publish
> npm run build && ./publish.sh


> vite-react-express@1.0.0 build
> npm --prefix ./frontend run build


> vite-react-frontend@0.0.0 build
> vite build

<details class="note" open>
<summary>Refresh the Express page</summary>
You'll notice that the browser page showing the site served by the Express backend will not update immediately. Nodemon watches all the files used by the Express server, and it restarts the server.

The Vite development server pushes changes to the browser live. This is why you see your changes appear immediately. This is not Nodemon's job.

All you have to do is refresh the page showing the site served by Express, and you will see that it matches the frontend.
