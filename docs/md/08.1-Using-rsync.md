The site served by your Express server has not changed. To get it to display the `index.html` file that you created in `frontend/dist/`, you will need to copy it from `frontend/dist/` to `backend/public`. You can do this in little steps.

You can start with a command that will copy your newest version of `index.html` into the `backend/public` folder, replacing the version that is currently there.

```bash-#
rsync -a ./frontend/dist/ ./backend/public/
```

<summary>`rsync` on Windows</summary>
If you are developing on Windows, using Git bash, you may need to [install `rsync`](https://gist.github.com/radleta/0b337a2b14f761951cf2aab0578512b9) manually before you can use it.

This command tells the `rsync` program to compare the items inside `frontend/dist/` with the files in `backend/public/`. If it finds any files or folders with the same names, it should copy _just the differences_ between these files and folders to `backend/public/`. The `-a` flag ensures that this behaves like an _archiving_ process: all modification dates, permissions and owner data will be preserved.

In a Terminal window:

1. Ensure that the Terminal is active the parent directory of your project and run the `rsync` command shown above.
2. Ensure that your server is running at port 3000
3. Open (or refresh) your browser at the address [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Your server is still serving up the `index.html` file that it finds in its `public/` folder, but this `index.html` file is now an exact copy of the `index.html` file in the `frontend/dist/` folder.
