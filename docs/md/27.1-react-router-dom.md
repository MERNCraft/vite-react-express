First you need to  `react-router-dom` to your frontend project:

1. Open a Terminal on your `frontend/` directory
2. Run the command
```bash-w
npm i react-router-dom
```

This is how your Terminal should appear:

```bash-#
<b>npm i react-router-dom</b>

## Adding frontend routes

To create two frontend routes, you're going to need to:

* Create a _page_ component for each route that will be displayed
* Create a hierarchy of `<Router>`, `<Routes>` and `<Route>` tags inside the `App.jsx` script.

1. Start by creating a new file at `frontend/src/pages/Page1.jsx`
2. Give it the boilerplace script that you can see below.

```jsx
/**
 * frontend/src/pages/Page1.jsx
 */

import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

export const Page1 = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Page 1 goes here</h1>
      <Link to="/page2" draggable="false">Page 2</Link>
      <Link to="/ping"  draggable="false">Ping</Link>
    </>
  )
}
```

1. Create a second file, in the same folder,  at `frontend/src/pages/Page2.jsx`
2. Give it the boilerplace script that you can find below.
```jsx
/**
 * frontend/src/pages/Page2.jsx
 */

import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

export const Page2 = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>This is Page 2</h1>
      <Link to="/page1" draggable="false">Page 1</Link>
      <Link to="/ping"  draggable="false">Ping</Link>
    </>
  )
}
```

4. Create a new file at `frontend/src/pages/NotFound.jsx`
5. Give it the boilerplace script that you see below. This will appear as a fallback page if the end-user tries to visit a page that does not exist.

```jsx
/**
 * frontend/src/pages/NotFound.jsx
 */

import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
  
export const NotFound = () => {  
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Page not found</h1>
      <Link to="/" draggable="false">Go to Page 1</Link>
    </>
  )
}
```

1. Replace the script of the file at `frontend/src/App.jsx` with the code below:
```jsx-
<i>/**
 * frontend/src/App.jsx
 */</i>
 
<b>import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Routes,
  Route
} from 'react-router-dom'</b>
<i>import './App.css'
import { Ping } from './components/Ping'</i>
<b>import { Page1 } from './pages/Page1'
import { Page2 } from './pages/Page2'
import { NotFound } from './pages/NotFound'</b>

<i>function App() {
  return (</i>
    <b><Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route index element={<Page1 />} />
        <Route path="/page1" element={<Page1 />} />
        <Route path="/page2" element={<Page2 />} />
        <Route path="/ping" element={<Ping />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router></b><i>
  )
}

export default App</i>
```

7. Add styling for links to `frontend/src/App.css`
```css-
<i>/**
 * frontend/src/App.css
 */

 pre {
  border: 1px inset #888;
  width: fit-content;
  min-width: 25em;
  min-height: 7em;
  overflow: auto;
}</i>

<b>a {
  display: block;
  width: 7em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  text-align: center;
  border: 1px outset #888;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  user-select: none;

  &:hover:active {
    border-style: inset;
    background-color: #000;
  }
}</b>
```

## Testing  the routes

1. Visit the development frontend at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
2. Click on the Link to [Page 2](http://localhost:5173/page2)

![Link to Page 2](images/LinkPage2.webp)


3. Notice how the contents of the page changes, and how the URL in the address updates to match the link that was clicked.

![Page 2](images/page2.webp)


Use different methods to move back and forth between these two pages:
   4. Use the anchor links in the pages
   5. Use the back ⬅️ and ➡️ forward buttons in the browser address bar
   6. Click in the browser address bar and press Enter to reload the page
   7. Press the `Ctrl-R` shortcut to reload the current page

## An unknown path?

8. Type an unknown path like [http://localhost:5173/unknown](http://localhost:5173/unknown) into your browser's address bar.
   
![There is no page with the path `/unknown`](images/notFound.webp)


You should find yourself on the Not Found page, with a link back to Page 1.

<summary>Can Express handle this?</summary>
Everything should work as you would expect in development mode. But will it break when your published React files are served by your Express backend?

SPOILER ALERT: yes, it will break.
