Oh... but first, now there's another issue. You can see it if you:

1. Run `npm run publish` in the parent directory
2. Reload [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
3. Look in the Development Console

![The Express server knows the `ORIGIN` that was set in the frontend](images/local_origin.webp)

Do you see it? The value that the frontend is using for `ORIGIN` has been logged to the Console. Sure, it's the right value. But... where was it set? Why was it set? Won't it ever change?

In the files that Vite created during the `build` process, the value for `import.meta.env.VITE_ORIGIN` has been hard-coded in. If you decide to run your production Express server on a different port than the one you used during development (port `3333` for example), then the frontend that your server delivers will attempt to connect to the _wrong_ backend. And your site will break.

This will need to be fixed, too, but you can only do one thing at a time. So write this on a Post-It note and stick it somewhere so you don't forget to deal with it later.
