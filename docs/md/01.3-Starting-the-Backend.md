In this part, you will be seeing how to use the backend and frontend that have already been built for you in the `Project` folder.

## Starting the backend
  
The frontend wants to connect to the backend, so you should start the backend running first. And before you can start the backend, you will need to install some Node modules. (This is treated in more depth in section [9. NodeJS and NPM](#nodejs-and-npm))

1. Open a Terminal window  on the `Project` directory
2. Run:
```bash-w
npm run setup
```

(You can find this script in `Project/package.json`.) Your Terminal will become busy displaying information and then it will stop. When it finishes, look in the `backend` and `frontend` directories. You'll see that in each of them there is a new `node_modules` directory, and a new file named `package-lock.json`.

3. In the same Terminal window, run:
```bash-w
npm start
```

You should see something like this.

```bash-w
james@M1 Project $ <b>npm start</b>

> vite-react-express@1.0.0 start
> npm run backend


> vite-react-express@1.0.0 backend
> npm --prefix ./backend start


> start
> nodemon server.js

[nodemon] 3.1.7
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,cjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`

Server listening at http://localhost:3000
```

The backend is already set up with some placeholder files in the folder at `Vite-React-Express/Project/backend/public`. You can:

1. Ctrl-Click on the link [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Click on the green GET /ping button

You should see a page like this:

Notice that the `referer` is `http://localhost:3000/`, which is where your server is running.
