When you started your server, you told `node` to run the `server.js` script. So `node` cached a copy of the script, and started running that. You have changed the contents of the _file_ `server.js`, but `node` doesn't know that, and so it cannot apply your changes.

Here's the quickest way to get the `/ping` endpoint to work:

1. Open the Terminal window where you launched the server with `npm start`
2. Press `^C` (Ctl-C) to stop the server.
3. Press the Up Arrow key on your keyboard. The command `npm start` should reapper.
4. Press Enter
5. In your browser visit the page that shows the site served by the Express server (which is currently showing `Cannot GET /ping`)
6. Refresh the page.

You should see something like this:

The date, time and location may be different for you.

<summary>Did you check `/req` earlier?</summary>
If you manually restarted the server to test the [http://localhost:3000/req](http://localhost:3000/req) path, then the `/ping` path will have started working at the same time for the same reason.
