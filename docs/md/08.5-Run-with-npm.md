In the last section, you added two script definitions to the `package.json` file at the root of your parent folder. Now you are ready to add a third script.

1. Edit the `package.json` file so that the `"scripts"` looks the same as in the code listing below:
2. 
```json
<i>{
  "name": "myproject",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "backend": "npm --prefix ./backend start",
    "start": "npm run backend"</i><b>,
    "publish": "./publish.sh"</b><i>
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}</i>
```


2. Now run `npm run publish` in your Terminal.

The `index.html` files are still identical, so the output should be similar to what is shown in the output in the last section.
