The good news is that there is a Node package called [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)(and [you can pronounce this any way you want](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon#pronunciation)), which will watch your files and restart your NodeJS app if any of your the files in your project change. 

You will probably want to use this for all your projects, so you can install it globally. with the following command:

```bash-w
npm install -g nodemon
```

The `-g` flag means "globally".

When you have done that, you can edit your file at `backend/package.json` so that the `"start"` script uses `nodemon` instead of `node`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.21.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon server.js"
  }
}
```


Now you can stop and restart your server:

1. Open the Terminal window where you originally ran `npm start`
2. Press `^C` (Ctl-C) to cancel the current process
3. Run `npm start` again, to relaunch your server using `nodemon`.

```bash
$ ^C
$ npm start
> npm run backend


> myproject@1.0.0 backend
> npm --prefix ./backend start


> start
> nodemon server.js

[nodemon] 3.1.7
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,cjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server listening at http://localhost:3000
```

4. Make a cosmetic change to the `ping()` function (adding a colon), just to test whether `nodemon` is doing its job:
```javascript-#13
<i>function ping(req, res) {
  const { protocol, path, ip } = req
  const { host, referer, origin } = req.headers
  
  const message = `Connection </i><b>from:</b><i>
referer ${referer}
origin  ${origin}
ip      ${ip}
for     ${protocol}://${host}${path}
at      ${Date()}`</i>
```


5. Visit  `http://localhost:3000/ping`

You should see the colon appear:

<details class="question" open>
<summary>http://localhost:3000/ping is working but...</summary>
... isn't this a problem?

Do you see that this is a problem? If I tell you that this _is_ a problem, can you work out what the problem is?

It should all become clear after you edit your frontend to access this API endpoint.
