While you are developing your site, it is good to use a separate repository for the frontend and the backend. During development, your Vite React frontend will be run by its own server on one port, and in will connect to the backend running on another port. You can keep the two repositories in separate folders inside a parent folder.

Your folder hierarchy will eventually look something like this:
```bash-#
MyProject
│
├── backend
│   ├── .env
│   ├── .git/
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── middleware/
│   ├── node_modules/
│   ├── package-lock.json
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── public/
│   ├── router.js
│   ├── server.js
│   └── public/
│
├── frontend
│   ├── .env
│   ├── .git/
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── dist/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── node_modules/
│   ├── package-lock.json
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── public/
│   ├── src/
│   └── vite.config.js
│
├── publish.sh
└── package.json
```

If you continue to Part 4 at the very end of the tutorial, where you learn to set up an Nginx reverse proxy to run your site locally with the HTTPS protocol, you will also have a folder named `nginx`. But that will be the cherry on the cake.

To start with you can create the basic directory hierarchy. In a Terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run the following command:

```bash-#
mkdir -p backend/public frontend/dist
```

If your parent folder were called `MyProject`, you would now have a directory structure like this:
```
MyProject
│ 
├── backend/
│   └── public/
│ 
└── frontend/
    └── dist/
```


You are now ready to create a minimal server and a minimal frontend for it to serve.
