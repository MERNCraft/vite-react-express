The Express backend serves up React static files that were built using Vite. These files have been minified. You'll find them in the `backend/assets/` folder.

If you want to modify the frontend as you normally do:

1. Open a new Terminal in Project directory and run:

```bash-w
npm run dev
```


You should see something like:

```bash-#
james@M1 Project $ <b>npm run dev</b>

> vite-react-express@1.0.0 dev
> npm --prefix ./frontend run dev


> vite-react-frontend@0.0.0 dev
> vite

VITE v6.0.1  ready in 98 ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
  âžœ  press h + enter to show help
```

2. Ctrl- (or Cmd-) Click on the URL to see it open in your browser.
3. Click on the green GET /ping button

The Vite development server launches its own frontend, using its own localhost port. By default this will be `5173`.

The client page in your browser will connect to the Express backend when it makes API requests. The Express backend allows CORS requests from any source during development, and logs the CORS exceptions that it makes for the frontend.

If you look in the Terminal window where you launched the backend, you will see that it has logged the fact that the frontend has been given permission to connect:

```bash-w

Server listening at http://localhost:3000
ðŸ¤šDEV: PASS /ping REQUEST FOR http://localhost:5173/
```

At the moment, the frontend and the backend are serving different files which happen to be identical, because of the workflow that you will be learning to set up.
