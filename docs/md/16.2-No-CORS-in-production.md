You are now ready to ensure that your backend Express server will only allow clients to use the response to requests if the request comes from the Express site itself.

1. Open `server.js`
2. Delete the temporary `console.log(...)` lines (11 - 16)
3. Add five new lines highlighted, so that your code matches the listing below.

```js
<i>/**
 * server.js
 */

require('dotenv').config()
			
const PROD_REGEX = /^(production|prod|staging|release|deploy)$/i
const is_dev = !PROD_REGEX.test(process.env.NODE_ENV)
process.env.IS_DEV = is_dev

const express = require('express')
const router = require('./router')
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000

const server = express()
</i><b>if (is_dev) {
  // Accept all requests... but only in dev mode
  console.log("ðŸ¤šUSING CORS FOR DEVELOPMENT")
  server.use(require('cors')())
}</b><i>

server.use(express.static('public'));
server.use('/', router)

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
})</i>
```

`nodemon` should now restart your server for you, and you should see this printed in the Terminal:
```bash-#
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
ðŸ¤šUSING CORS FOR DEVELOPMENT
Server listening at http://localhost:3333
```

## Switch back to production mode

1. Edit your `backend/.env` file as shown below, so that the frontend will find the backend where it expects to find it on port 3000.
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```
2. In the Terminal where `nodemon` is running, stop `nodemon` by pressing `^C` (Ctl-C).
3. Restart `nodemon` manually by running `npm start`
4. Look at the last couple of lines in the Terminal:
```bash-#
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server listening at http://localhost:3000
```
This time, the line `ðŸ¤šUSING CORS FOR DEVELOPMENT` is not shown. In production mode, your server is not using the `cors` module.

## And... back to development mode

For the next part of this tutorial, you should be working in development mode, knowing that your backend server will be more secure when it is running in production mode later.

1. Edit your `backend/.env` file as shown below, so that the frontend will find the backend where it expects to find it on port 3000.
   
```bash
NODE_ENV=dev
PORT=3000
```

2. In the Terminal where `nodemon` is running, stop `nodemon` by pressing `^C` (Ctl-C).
3. Restart `nodemon` manually by running `npm start`

You won't need to change this for a while.
