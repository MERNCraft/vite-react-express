The problem is occurring in the frontend code, in the `Ping.jsx` component.

The frontend doesn't know when it's being served by the Vite development server or by your Express backend, so you have to give a way to find out.

By default, Vite will use port `5173` for the frontend development server. However, if you happen to have more than one Vite frontend running, it will use port `5174` or `5175` or whichever is the next free port number.

The solution is to check if the frontend is running at `localhost:517X`, where 'X' is a number. If it is, then the chances are that the frontend is running in development mode. In this case, yes, you do want to use the value of `VITE_ORIGIN` that was stored in the `frontend/.env` file. 

If the frontend is _not_ running in development mode, then you want to use `""` instead of this hard-coded value of `import.meta.env.VITE_ORIGIN`.

1. Fix the `frontend/src/components/Ping.jsx` script by adding the lines shown in Listing 70 below.

```js-
<i>/**
 * frontend/src/components/Ping.jsx
 */

import React, { useState } from 'react'
const TAG_REGEX = /(<.*?>)|(<\/.*?>)/g
const ORIGIN = import.meta.env.VITE_ORIGIN
</i><b>const dev = /^localhost:517\d$/.test(window.location.host)
const origin = dev ? ORIGIN : "" // "" in production mode

console.log("ORIGIN:", ORIGIN);
console.log("dev:", dev);
console.log("origin:", origin)</b><i>

export const Ping = () => {
  const [ response, setResponse ] = useState("")

  const getPing = () => {
    fetch(`${origin}/ping`)
      .then(incoming => incoming.text())
      // Always sanitize data from unreliable sources
      .then(text => text.replace(TAG_REGEX, ""))
      .then(text => setResponse(text))
      .catch(error => setResponse(error.message))
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button
        onClick={getPing}
      >
        GET /ping
      </button>
      <pre>
        {response}
      </pre>
    </>
  )
}</i>
```

2. From a Terminal active in the parent folder of your project, run `npm run publish`
3. Visit  [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)again
4. Click on the `GET /ping` button.

And now, your production backend works as expected, regardless of its domain name and port number, and regardless of which backend server the development frontend expected to connect to.

## Back to `dev` mode

If all the tests that you ran above worked the way I explained that they should, then switch your backend back to development mode.

1. Reset the file at `backend/.env`, so that it uses the values that your development frontend is expecting

```bash-
<b>NODE_ENV=dev
PORT=3000</b>
<i>JWT_SECRET=go hang a salami
COOKIE_SECRET=I'm a lasagna hog</i>
```


2. Restart the backend server, so that it will read in the reset values from `.env`.

<summary>A more complex frontend</summary>
So far, I've kept the frontend as simple as possible, with just enough functionality to test that a backend Express server can be used to serve up a React frontend built with Vite. In the next chapter, you can create a more complex frontend, and see if any adjustments will needed in the backend.
