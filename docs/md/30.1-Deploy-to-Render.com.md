## Create an account on Render.com

If you don't already have an account on Render.com:
1. Visit [Render.com](https://render.com/)
2. Click on the Get Started For Free button

![Choose Get Started for Free](images/RenderFree.webp)

3. Create an account. The easiest way is to link to your GitHub account.

![Fill in the Create Account form](images/CreateAccount.webp)

4. On the next page, click on the + New button and then select Web Service from the drop-down menu:

![Create a New Web Service](images/NewWebService.webp)

5. The next page asks you for lots of data, starting with the link to your GitHub repository. You can find this by clicking the green <> Code button in your GitHub repo page, as shown in Figure 45 at the end of the [previous section](#deploy-to-host).

6. Next, you'll be asked how Render.com should install all your NodeJS package dependencies and start your server.
	- For **Build Command**, can change this to the `npm install` that you are used to. The default `yarn` setting will work, but it will complain at you for not using `yarn` during development.
	- For **Start Command**, you should use `node server.js`. The Render.com site will take care of restarting your server if it fails. `nodemon` is therefore not necessary.
	- For the **Instance Type**, you can choose the Free option

7. You will also need to add three Environment Variables. You can import these from your `backend/.env` file.

   **Important: Ensure that the value you use for `NODE_ENV` is `production`**

8. Click on Deploy Web Service

Render.com will take you to a new page where you see feedback on the installation, build and deployment process. Eventually it will tell you that **Your service is live ðŸŽ‰**.

You'll find a link to your deployed web service near the top left of the page.

9. Click on the link, and check that the Page 1, Page 2 and Ping links all behave as you would expect.
10. When you click on the `GET /ping` button, though, you'll be disappointed.

![The GET /ping Button Will Fail](images/FailedPing.webp)

Instead of responding with the output of the `/ping` function, the deployed server responds with the contents of the `index.html` file, stripped of all its tags.

If you look in the output on the page on Render.com where you deployed your server, you should see these clues about what is going wrong:

```bash-w
Server listening at http://localhost:10000
origin: http://vite-react-express.onrender.com/
```
```bash-s
# Lines skipped
```
```bash-w
referer: https://vite-react-express.onrender.com/ping
payload: http://vite-react-express.onrender.com/
```
The server that you wrote is running in the insecure HTTP mode, but Render.com has wrapped it with a secure HTTPS reverse proxy. As a result, the payload in your cookie is being set with the `http` protocol, because that's what `server.js` thinks its protocol is. But the `referer` contains the `https` protocol set up by Render.com's reverse proxy.

<summary>Which PORT?</summary>
Notice also that Render.com has set the value of `process.env.PORT` to `10000`. Your default of `3000` has been ignored.

</details>

<summary>Final fixes</summary>
It looks like you are going to have to make an adjustment for this. Whatever you change, it must still work with the `http`  protocol that you are using for development.
