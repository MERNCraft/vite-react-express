In your Terminal open in the `backend/` directory, run the command:

```bash
node server.js
```

This tells the NodeJS application to read the `server.js` file, and to follow the instructions. You should see something like the following in the Terminal window:

```bash-#
$ <b>node server.js</b>
Server listening at http://localhost:3000
```

You can press the `Ctrl` key (or `Cmd` if your are working on a Mac) and at the same time click on the link `http://localhost:3000`. Your favourite browser should open and show the "Placeholder" site that you created in [8. Minimal Backend](#placeholder-backend). This time, the URL in the address bar is different.

You've done quite a lot of work, just to get back to almost the same place where you started. But now, you are not just a passenger; you are in control of where things are going to go. So now, you can start delegating some of your work.
