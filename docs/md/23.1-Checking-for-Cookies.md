If you refresh your browser, nothing seems to have changed. Nothing is logged into the Terminal window, because there are no `console.log()` statements in `serveCookie.js` any more. 

But if you use the Developer Tools in your browser, you'll see that it now shows that you have cookies.

In Google Chrome, you need to select the Application tab and then choose Cookies in the Storage section on the left. You may need to click on the disclosure triangle and then select `http://localhost:3000`.

In Mozilla Firefox you need to select the Storage tab and then choose Cookies in the section on the left. You may need to click on the disclosure triangle and then select `http://localhost:3000`.

<summary>No Storage Tab?</summary>
If you don't immediately see a Storage tab in Firefox:
1. Click on the three dots at the right end of the Developer Tools menu
2. Select Settings
3. Check the Storage checkbox
