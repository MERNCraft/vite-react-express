Before explaining how to fix the problem with Cross Origin Resource Sharing, it's important to make something clear. The Express backend _did_ send the expected data to you browser. Here's the proof, as provided by Firefox v 133.0.3:

To see this for yourself, you'll need to use Firefox. All other browser that I've tried (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Opera) pretend that they don't know anything about the response:

1. Open [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
2. Use it to visit h[ttp://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
3. Open the Developer tools
4. Select the Network tab

<details class="tip">
<summary>No Network tab?</summary>
If you don't immediately see a Network tab, you can:

1. Click on the three dots at the right end of the Developer Tools menu bar
2. Select settings
3. Check the Network checkbox

5. Click on the `GET /ping` button to initiate a request
6. Click on the new line that appears in the Network pane
7. Click on the Response tab in the details pane that appears.

## What does Express think it's doing?

I imagine that you might have a number of questions at this point. Like:

* If the request came from an unauthorized origin, why did Express not simply return something like `403 Unauthorized`?
* Why did it both send the response _and_ fail to send an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, so that your browser refuses to give your `fetch()` request access to the response?
* Didn't Express use more CPU cycles than necessary to handle a request that the browser will refuse to treat?
* Wasn't this a waste of bandwidth?

Express is designed to be _unopinionated_. It will respond to any request that it is sent, using as much CPU energy as is required to generate that response. It will also warn your well-behaved browser not to use the response.

If _you_ want to prevent Express from doing any work on unauthorized requests, then that is _your_ responsibility. And you should take it.

## What is CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header?

The purpose of CORS is to protect your browser (and you) from malicious attacks. Suppose you are visiting a site that shows innocuous funny cat pics, and while you are logged on you decide to visit your bank's web site. You fill in the authorization form, and the bank's web site sends an authentication code to your browser.

The not-so-innocuous funny cat pics web site now sends its own request to your bank's web site, with the authentication code that is now stored in your browser. The bank's site is not as well-designed as it could be, and sends a response.

But the IP address of the funny cat pics web site is not white-listed by the bank, so it _does not_ send an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. As a result, the JavaScript on the funny cat pics web site cannot access the response, and your identity and bank account are still safe.

To be fair, bank web sites are likely to be hypersecure. I used a bank as an example to give an idea of the gravity of the problem. The stakes are not so high if you logged on to the latest social media web site, but could be more embarrassing.
